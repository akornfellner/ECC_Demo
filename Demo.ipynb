    "# Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a type of public key cryptography that uses the mathematics behind elliptic curves to provide strong security with relatively small keys. ECC is becoming more widely used as it offers the same security as RSA with a smaller key size, which makes it more efficient. The security of ECC is based on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). The ECDLP is the hard problem of trying to find the integer `n`, given the points `P`, `Q` on the elliptic curve, where $Q = n \\cdot P$. This problem is known to be difficult to solve, which is what provides the basis for the security of ECC.\n",

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)\n",
    "\n",
    "ECDH is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic curve public-private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key which can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "ECDSA is a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curve cryptography. It is used to create a digital signature of data (a number derived from the secret key and the data) which can be verified by anyone who has the public key, thereby proving that the data came from the person who holds the associated private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, ECC is a powerful tool in the field of cryptography, providing efficient and secure methods for encryption, digital signatures, and key agreement.\n",
